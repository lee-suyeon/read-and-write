## 1. Let's Talk About Frameworks

---

### What is a framework?

> A supporting **structure** around which something _can be built_.

<br />

### Comparing Frameworks to Libraries

A framework calls your code. Your code calls a library

- framework : Angular, Vue.js
- library : Moment.js, Lodash

<br />

### React

> a javascript **library** for building _user interfaces_

- manipulate the DOM ❌ ,modify the state of a component
  ➡️ React modifies the DOM for you.
- declarative pattern

<br />

### Technical debt.

- Every framework has a cost in terms of the difficulty to change the code in the future.
